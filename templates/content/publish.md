Publishing your data consists of two parts:

* An [endpoint](#endpoint) from where the data can be downloaded
* A [source](#source) where the information contained in the data is presented on your website

### Endpoint

The endpoint is a URL where a user can download the data.
Publish your data at a public endpoint, in a way which anyone can download and use it.

The endpoint is usually a single file hosted on your website.
Alternatively, you can provide your data using a WFS or other API,
or using a third-party service such as GitHub or ArcGIS which allows the data to be downloaded.

Ensure your endpoint is documented on a public webpage to help people find and use the data.

The documentation webpage for your endpoint should include a clear statement that the data is provided as open data under
the [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

### Source

The source page is a URL where a user can see the same information in the data.
This is usually existing planning policy, or other webpages on your official website.

It is important that the source page links to the endpoint documentation webpage to 
help users trust the authenticity of the data.
