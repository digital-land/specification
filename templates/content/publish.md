Publishing your data consists of two parts:

* An **endpoint** where the data can be downloaded from
* A **source webpage** where the information contained in the data is presented on your website

### Endpoint

Make your data available at a public endpoint. 
An endpoint is a URL from which anyone can download the data. This can be either: 

* a single file hosted on your website 
* a file hosted on another public website including GitHub
* an Open Geospatial Consortium Web Feature Service (OGC WFS) 
* an open application programming interface (API) such as ArcGIS

Ensure your endpoint URL is documented and linked to from a public webpage to help people easily find and download the data.

The documentation webpage for your endpoint should include a clear statement that the data is provided as open data under
the [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

### Source webpage

The source webpage is where a user can see the same information that is shown in the data.
This is usually one of your existing planning policy pages on your official <code>.gov.uk</code> website.

It is important that the source webpage links to the endpoint documentation webpage to 
help users trust the authenticity of the data.
