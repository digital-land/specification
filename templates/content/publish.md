Publishing your data consists of two parts:

* An **endpoint** where the data can be downloaded from
* A **source webpage** where the information contained in the data is presented on your website

### Endpoint

Publish your data at a public endpoint, in a way in which anyone can download and use it.

The endpoint is a URL from which the data can be downloaded.
This can be a single file hosted on your website.
Or, you can serve your data using an OGC WFS or other API
using a third-party service such as GitHub or ArcGIS.

Ensure your endpoint URL is documented and linked to from a public webpage to help people easily find and download the data.

The documentation webpage for your endpoint should include a clear statement that the data is provided as open data under
the [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

### Source webpage

The source webpage is where a user can see the same information that is shown in the data.
This is usually one of your existing planning policy pages on your official <code>.gov.uk</code> website.

It is important that the source webpage links to the endpoint documentation webpage to 
help users trust the authenticity of the data.
