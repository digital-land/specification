Start by reviewing any data we may already have about your organisation
on [planning.data.gov.uk](https://planning.data.gov.uk)
using the [check and provide service](https://provide.planning.data.gov.uk).
This may include any data you have provided in the past, along with
information found on your website, or in other open data.

We will take the most recent data you provide as being more authoritative
than any data we have collected from you previously, or found in other sources.

You can download tabular data we have for your organisation as a CSV file
from the [check and provide service](https://provide.planning.data.gov.uk)
and edit it using a spreadsheet or other CSV editors.

Similarly, you can download geospatial data we have for your organisation as
CSV or GeoJSON from [planning.data.gov.uk](https://planning.data.gov.uk)
and modify it using QGIS or other GIS tools.

You must provide data containing the mandatory fields identified here where 
required by law.
Otherwise your data does not need to be complete or perfect to start with.
For many purposes having some data is better than no data,
so start by providing the best {{specification["plural"]}} information you have,
and continue to iterate and improve it over time.
