You should continue to improve your data, and act on the feedback from the [check and provide service](https://provide.planning.data.gov.uk) 
to ensure your data meets the specification.

You will also need to update and republish your data whenever there's a change to your {{specification["plural"]}} information.

We look for changes to the data at all of the endpoint URLs we know about every night,
so we can quickly update [planning.data.gov.uk](https://planning.data.gov.uk).

It is simpler if you publish your changes to the same endpoint URL.
If you create a new endpoint you will need to [tell us about your data](#tell-us-about-your-data) again.
