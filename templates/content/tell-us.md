Once you have published the data, tell us about it so we can index and quickly make it available 
nationally on [planning.data.gov.uk](https://planning.data.gov.uk).

Use the [check and provide service](https://provide.planning.data.gov.uk/) to tell us where it is. 

You will need to provide for each dataset:

* the source URL where the information in the data is presented on your website
* the endpoint URL from which the data can be collected

The provide service also asks for your name and email address as a point of contact in case of any issues.
