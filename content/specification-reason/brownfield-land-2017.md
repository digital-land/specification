    [The Town and Country Planning (Brownfield Land Register) Regulations 2017](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/403/contents/made)
    require local planning authorities to maintain a register of their brownfield sites that are suitable for housing.
name: 'The Town and Country Planning (Brownfield Land Register) Regulations 2017'
notes: |
    The specification remains backwards compatible with the data standard as set out in the regulations.
    Some changes made include deprecating a number of fields unused by the Planning Data Platform 
    which contained information which can be easily infered from other fields or ignored.
    The specification adds on ptional an `endDate` field which may be used when removing entries from a register.
