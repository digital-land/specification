guidance: |
    Enter reference to help people find and link to the data.
    If you don’t have a reference for this item, you will need to create one that is:

    * unique within your data
    * persistent — it doesn’t change when the data is updated

    A good reference is something you already use.
    Where these aren't unique, you make them unique by appending the year, or even the full date.
    Great references are short, easy to read, to pronounce and remember.
