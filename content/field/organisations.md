    A list of CURIE references for one or more organisations.
    Where you need to list more than one organisation, separate the values with a semicolon ';' character.
    You can find the CURIE reference for each organisation from our [list of organisations](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/organisation/).
    The CURIE is made from the prefix value, followed by a colon ':' character, and then the reference value for the organisation being identified. 
    You may leave this value blank when the list of organisations is just the single organisation providing the data.
examples:
    - value: 'local-authority:DUR'
    - value: 'national-park-authority:Q72617158'
    - value: 'local-authority:LIC;local-authority:NKE;local-authority:WLI'
