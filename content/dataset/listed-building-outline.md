This dataset contains geospatial boundary or extent information about listings.

It can be used for identifying and protecting buildings of special architectural or historic interest, ensuring that any work on or near these properties requires special consent and design considerations to prevent harm to the building's significance.

This spatial data can help in planning applications, conservation efforts, and policy development by showing the locations and boundaries of designated heritage assets, influencing development proposals and land use decisions. 

This dataset does not consistently show the curtilage of listed buildings for planning purposes and should only be used as an indicative guide. We encourage users to make further checks before making any planning decision.

Data shows the extent of the land associated with the listing. This dataset is a work in progress and does not have full coverage across England.
