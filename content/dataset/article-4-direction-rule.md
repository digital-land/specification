A local planning authority may create an [article 4 direction](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/when-is-permission-required#article-4-direction) to alter or remove [permitted development rights](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/permitted-development-rights-for-householders-technical-guidance) from a building or area.

The article 4 direction rule is a category for the rule which have been withdrawn or altered.
Each [article 4 direction](/dataset/article-4-direction) may apply to one or more [article 4 direction areas](/dataset/article-4-direction-area), each with one or more article 4 direction rules.

This dataset contains data from [a small group of local planning authorities](/about/) who we are working with to develop a [data specification for article 4 directions](https://www.digital-land.info/guidance/specifications/article-4-direction).
