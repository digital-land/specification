  description: short description of the dataset without the definite article, sentence captialisation or a punctuation mark.
  guidance: |
     Enter a description of the dataset which could be used in a sentence such as "A dataset containing *description* in England." 

     The description is intended to be used in tables and content, so shouldn't start with the definite article ("The", "A", etc)
     or end with a full-stop or other punctuation mark. 
     The description shouldn't start with a capital letter, unless the first word is a proper-noun, such as "Local Planning Authority".
     This allows a user to capitalise the first letter or add a full-stop when using the description in a sentence.
  examples:
    - value: "land that has been previously been developed"
    - value: "local plans prepared by a Local Planning Authority"
    - value: 'Local Planning Authorities and their boundaries'
