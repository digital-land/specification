This dataset contains boundaries for land designated by a local planning authority as being [green belt](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/green-belt),
grouped using the [greenbelt core](/dataset/greenbelt-core) category.

It can be used for planning purposes, such as preparing local plans to define areas that are kept permanently open and free from urban sprawl.

Local planning authorities provide annual returns in March and we publish the data in autumn. This provides a snapshot in time and won't reflect any changes to green belt boundaries made since the local planning authorities submitted their annual returns.
