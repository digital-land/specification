Sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) are nationally protected sites that have features such as wildlife or geology. 

SSSIs are designated by [Natural England](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england).
There is [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest) to help local authorities decide on planning applications in protected SSSIs.
