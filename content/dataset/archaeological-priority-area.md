The Greater London Archaeological Priority Areas (APAs) are areas in London that have significant archaeological interest or potential for new discoveries

The APAs are based on evidence in the Greater London Historic Environment Record (GLHER)
They were created in the 1970s and 1980s by boroughs and local museums
They are being updated using new evidence and standards
The new system assigns all land to one of four tiers based on archaeological risk
