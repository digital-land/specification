Flood zones are a guide produced by the Environment Agency to demonstrate the probability of river and sea flooding in areas across England. Flood zones are based on the likelihood of an area flooding, with flood zone 1 areas least likely to flood and flood zone 3 areas more likely to flood. 

The flood zones were produced to help developers, councils and communities understand the flood risks present in specific locations or regions. Despite being a very useful indicator of an areaâ€™s flood risk, the zones cannot tell you whether a location will definitely flood or to what severity.
