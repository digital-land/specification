This dataset contains the boundaries of conservation areas from Historic England, as well as other data found on [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/search?q=conservation+area) and currently contains a number of duplicate areas we are working to remove.

It can be used for informing developers if their prospective development is going to be in a conservation area.
