This dataset is primarily intended to be used for informing development decisions.

This dataset is incomplete, and contains some authoritative data provided by local authorities, 
as well as conservation area boundaries from Historic England, and other secondary sources found on
[data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/search?q=conservation+area). 
The data currently contains a number of duplicate areas we are working to remove.
