Local planning authorities are responsible for designating conservation areas, though [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/) and the Secretary of State also have powers to create them.

This dataset also contains the boundaries of conservation areas from Historic England, as well as other data found on [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/search?q=conservation+area) and currently contains a number of duplicate areas we are working to remove.

We are also [working with a group of local planning authorities](/about/) to help them publish their conservation areas, and to develop a [data specification for conservation areas](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/conservation-area/).

Historic England provide [guidance](https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/your-home/owning-historic-property/conservation-area/) to help householders understand the implications of living in a conservation area for planning applications.
