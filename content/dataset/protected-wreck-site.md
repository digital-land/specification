Protected wrecks are records of wreck sites, documented losses and seabed archaeological features.Â  They can be protected by designation under the [Protection of Wrecks Act 1973](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/33), the [Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/46/contents) and the [Protection of Military Remains Act 1986](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/35/contents).

The Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 allows the Secretary of State for [Digital, Culture, Media and Sport](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport) to designate a restricted area around the site of a vessel lying on or in the seabed in UK territorial waters. They do so with advice from [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/).

Where a protected wreck site is within local authority boundaries then it will be considered a designated heritage asset for the purpose of the NPPF and offered the same level of protection in planning decisions as is afforded to scheduled monuments and highly graded listed buildings.
