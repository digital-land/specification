This dataset contains the extent of groups of trees covered by a tree preservation order.

It can be used for managing and protecting important trees by preventing their unauthorised removal or damage.

Members of the public and developers use the data to check if a tree is protected and to inform planning applications or tree work proposals. The data helps ensure trees remain a significant part of the local environment and public amenity.

This dataset contains data from [a small group of local planning authorities](/about/) who we are working with to develop a [data specification for tree preservation orders](https://www.digital-land.info/guidance/specifications/tree-preservation-order).
