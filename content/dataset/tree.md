A Tree Preservation Order (TPO) can be placed on single trees, groups of trees and even whole woodlands. Tree Preservation Orders are made by local planning authorities following [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tree-preservation-orders-and-trees-in-conservation-areas) provided by the [Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities).

Each [tree preservation order](/dataset/tree-preservation-order) may apply to a number of [tree preservation order zones](/dataset/tree-preservation-order-zone), and a number of individual trees.

This dataset contains data from [a small group of local planning authorities](/about/) who we are working with to develop a [data specification for tree preservation orders](https://www.digital-land.info/guidance/specifications/tree-preservation-order).
