This dataset contains information on trees with preservation orders.

It can be used for managing and protecting important trees by preventing their unauthorised removal or damage. 

Members of the public and developers use the data to check if a tree is protected and to inform planning applications or tree work proposals. The data helps ensure trees remain a significant part of the local environment and public amenity.
