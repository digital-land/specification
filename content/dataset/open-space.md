Open space, which includes all open space of public value, can include formal sports pitches, open areas within a development and country parks. It can provide health and recreation benefits to people living and working nearby and have an ecological value.

Local planning authorities should assess the need for open space and opportunities for new provision in their areas and this could affect planning decisions.

Authorities and developers may refer to [Sport England’s guidance](http://www.sportengland.org/facilities-planning/planning-for-sport/planning-tools-and-guidance/) on how to assess the need for sports and recreation facilities. There is also [guidance on Local Green Space designation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/open-space-sports-and-recreation-facilities-public-rights-of-way-and-local-green-space#Local-Green-Space-designation), which may form part of the overall open space network within an area.
