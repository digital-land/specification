Open space can include formal sports pitches, open areas within a development and country parks. It provides health and recreation benefits to people living and working nearby or has an ecological value.

### Impact on planning decisions

Local planning authorities should assess the need for open space and opportunities for new provision in their areas and this could affect planning decisions.

### Responsible organisations and guidance

Authorities and developers may refer to [Sport England's guidance](http://www.sportengland.org/facilities-planning/planning-for-sport/planning-tools-and-guidance/) on how to assess the need for sports and recreation facilities. There is also [guidance on Local Green Space designation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/open-space-sports-and-recreation-facilities-public-rights-of-way-and-local-green-space#Local-Green-Space-designation), which may form part of the overall open space network within an area.
