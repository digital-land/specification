A building or site in a local planning authorityâ€™s area that make a positive contribution to its local character and sense of place because of their heritage value. Although such heritage assets may not be nationally designated or even located within the boundaries of a conservation area, they may be offered some level of protection by the local planning authority identifying them on a formally adopted list of local heritage assets.

This is an experimental dataset of locally listed buildings found on [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/search?q=locally+listed+buildings).
We are [working with a group of local planning authorities](/about/) to help them publish their locally listed buildings, and to develop a data specification for locally listed buildings.
