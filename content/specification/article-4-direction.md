    - dataset: article-4-direction
      name: article 4 direction
      fields:
        - field: reference
          description: the <a href="#reference">reference</a> for the article 4 direction
          guidance: |
            A reference or ID for each article 4 direction that is:

            - unique within your dataset
            - permanent - it doesn’t change when the dataset is updated
            If you don’t use a reference already, you will need to create one. This can be a short set of letters or numbers.

            Example: `A4D1`
        - field: name
          description: the name of the article 4 direction
          guidance: |
            The official name of the article 4 direction.

            Example: `Old Market`"
        - field: description
          description: a brief description of the article 4 direction
          guidance: |
            Optional short description of the article 4 direction’s purpose.

            Example: The railways arches should not be demolished or have their use changed from commercial to residential.
        - field: documentation-url
          description: the URL of the web page where you can find information about the article 4 direction
          guidance: |
            The URL of the webpage on your website that introduces the document.

            Each document should be linked to from a documentation webpage that includes a short description of the data and the document you’re linking to. Each article 4 direction should have a unique URL. This means you can create a separate page for each one, or you could list several on one page. If you do that, there must be a separate anchor link (fragment identifier) for each one.

            This means each section of your page should have its own URL. Most publishing systems will allow you to use a hashtag to create the identifiers for each article 4 direction you list - as in the examples shown.

            Example:

            One article 4 direction per page:

            `http://www.LPAwebsite.org.uk/data/article4directions/smithroad`

            More than one article 4 direction per page with an anchor link for each one:

            `http://www.LPAwebsite.org.uk/data/article4directions#smithroad`

            `http://www.LPAwebsite.org.uk/data/article4directions#broadhousepark`
        - field: document-url
          description: the URL of the web page where you can find the document for the article 4 direction
          guidance: |
            The URL of an authoritative order or notice designating the article 4 direction.

            Example: `http://www.LPAwebsite.org.uk/article4direction1.pdf`

            Where the article 4 direction is [no longer valid](https://standards.planning-data.dev/principles/#we-shouldn%E2%80%99t-delete-entries-in-a-register), this should be the date that it was no longer in effect, written in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. If this does not apply, leave the cell blank.

            Example: `1999-01-20`
    - dataset: article-4-direction-area
      name: article 4 direction area

          guidance: |
            A list of the permitted development rights withdrawn by the article 4 direction.

            Separate the rights in the list using semicolons.

            Only use rights from our [permitted development right dataset](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/permitted-development-right). If the area withdraws a permitted development right that is not in our dataset, email digitalland@communities.gov.uk.

            Example: `3D;3M;11B`

          description: unique property reference numbers for any addressable properties, separated by `;`
          guidance: |
            If the geometry is the boundary of a building, you can provide the Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN). Find the UPRN on GeoPlace.

            If you provide the UPRN, you must also provide the address text.

            If you’re providing geometry in a CSV, geometry should be in well-known text (WKT).

            Example: `MULTIPOLYGON (((1.188829 51.23478,1.188376 51.234909,1.188381 51.234917,1.187912 51.235022...`
