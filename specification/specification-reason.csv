",The Town and Country Planning (Brownfield Land Register) Regulations 2017,"The specification remains backwards compatible with the data standard as set out in the regulations.
Some changes made include deprecating a number of fields unused by the Planning Data Platform 
which contained information which can be easily infered from other fields or ignored.
The specification adds on ptional an `endDate` field which may be used when removing entries from a register.

,,,,2025-11-07,"The Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) regulations require all local planning authorities that 
issue a CIL liability notice or enter into section 106 planning obligations during a reporting year 
to publish an infrastructure funding statement (IFS) at least annually. 
The infrastructure funding statement should, as a minimum, include the information set out in 
[Schedule 2 to the Community Infrastructure Levy regulations 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2010/9780111492390/contents)
(as inserted by the 2019 regulations).

In addition, it is recommended that local authorities also publish the raw data that informed the infrastructure funding statement.
This guidance sets out a data format and approach that you can follow in order to publish data that sits behind the infrastructure statement.

The data format and infrastructure funding statements will give policy makers and communities better insight into how developer contributions
are supporting new development and local infrastructure.
We have designed the data format to cause as little disruption as possible to existing processes.
